v0.8.1 (December 19, 2017)
==========================

- fix bug when converting stange/invalid timestamps to datetimes
- add missing ``created_at`` and ``updated_at`` in ``Chat`` resources

v0.8.0 (December 15, 2017)
==========================

This version represents a significant, backwards-incompatible change! The old
API was brittle, poorly designed, and very difficult to test.

- No more global api key; create clients using a specific api key instead
- Added missing group functionality:
	- joining with a share token
	- rejoining a former group
	- changing group ownership
- Added additional endpoints:
	- leaderboard
	- blocks
- Reverse engineered the undocumented gallery endpoint
	- has all known supported listing methods
	- supports before, after, and since with UTC ``datetime`` s
- Added paging control for endpoints that support it
- Message paging now maintains the order in which they come from the API:
	- "before" messages go back in time
	- "after" messages go forward in time
- much more grandular exceptions and no layer violations
- removal of Pillow depenedency for images; simply upload/download image bytes and do with them as you please
- result filtering has been moved and improved
	- can now make and reuse a filter
	- can create arbitrary sets of tests and use them in a filter
- now uses the Apache license instead of GPLv3

- Updated the list of contributors
